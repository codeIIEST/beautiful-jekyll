title: Linus Chapter

In the 70s and 80s, Richard Stallman, formerly of the MIT AI Lab, initiated the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation. With the source-code release of the Netscape Navigator, the term open-source got associated and it was adopted by many in the "free-software" community to counter the ideological confrontations that comes with using the term free software. The Open Source Initiative was created as an educational initiative, but gradually the number of Open-sourced softwares, contributors and organisations increased.

The Linus Chapter, one of the four chapters of CodeIIEST was created as a platform for enthusiastic coders who use and contribute to open-sourced code repositories. We have members who contribute to open-source projects and are preparing for Google Summer of Code, and our aim is to increase the number of open-source enthusiasts. Here, at the Linus chapter, you are not limited by any domain, as knowledge here is open-sourced, and all for you to take.
